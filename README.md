Reflection (200–300 words)
For this portfolio I focused on clarity and accessibility. I used a clear visual hierarchy by applying a typographic scale (large headline, smaller lead text) and consistent spacing so that users can quickly scan content. Navigation is simple and consistent: top navigation with clear labels and a sticky header ensures quick access to sections; on small screens a toggle button provides compact access while preserving structure.
Responsiveness was implemented mobile-first; CSS grid and flexible images produce layouts that adapt from single-column on phones to two-column on larger screens. Readability is enhanced through adequate line-length, font size, and line-height; color choices maintain strong contrast for body text against background. I included alt attributes for images and semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer) to improve screen reader experience and structure. Buttons and links have visible focus states and accessible labels.
Challenges included balancing visual richness with minimal cognitive load — I prioritized concise copy, white space, and clear CTAs (Resume, Contact, View Projects) to reduce friction. I also intentionally kept JavaScript minimal to avoid performance impacts. Next improvements: integrate real contact handling (server or form service), add performance optimizations (image compression, lazy-loading), expand project case studies with measurable outcomes, and run automated accessibility checks (axe / Lighthouse) for tweaks.
